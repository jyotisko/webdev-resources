# Code Editors:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): This is the best editor for web development in my opinion. I have been using VS Code since a long time. What makes VS Code special is the extension marketplace. You can make this editor as your own with different themes, fonts and wide variety of extension. 
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): Sublime, a very light-weight text editor, great for beginners and intermediate web developers, it too has a wide variety of extensions and themes. It can be used for quick fixes in your code.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): Atom is also a good text editor if you are starting out.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): Vim is code editor mainly focused on using keyboard. It has many shortcuts that can help you to code fast, but its not well recommended for web development.

# Web Design Tools
